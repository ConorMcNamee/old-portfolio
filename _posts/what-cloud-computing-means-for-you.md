Cloud Computing is the latest and greatest in the tech world but what is the hype all about? What actually is the cloud and does it affect me? You may be thinking all of these things and maybe more and luckily for you I have the answers!

There are many different types of businesses and I am going to talk about what types of businesses and companies need the cloud, how it actually benefits you and if it is worth the move. 

First to understand how the cloud affects you, you must understand what you are dealing with. According to wikipedia, "Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power"

Basically, its a server managed by someone else that you can access and use whenever you like. You don't have to pay for server space, you don't have to pay for computer hardware or a datacenter rental. You just pay for what you use. This concept of pay for what you use is key!

So what does this mean for you and your business? This means your data is safer, can scale much easier and most of all is much more cost effective. Which at the end of the day, is the most important factor. With the cloud, because you only pay for what you use means you can save so much money in the long run. It means you aren't paying for unused hosting resources and you are getting enough resources if you need them

# So who needs the Cloud?

Everyone. If you are a small business and you want a small 3 page website that doesn't need much except maybe a contact us page? Thats great you will save so much money on hosting. Are you a startup that is looking to gain an extra 10,000 users every month. Fantastic, you can scale up as you need it

Are you a startup owner. Like I said before the cloud provides fantastic options for scalibility. Whether you have 100 users or 100 million the cloud has options for you.

When choosing a developer for your website. Choose a developer who knows how to develop in the cloud.
